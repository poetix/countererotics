Manifesto
For an axiomatic anti-pornography.

What axioms? The following:

* Pornography is not the simple visibility of sex, but the simultaneous visibility of sex and money: in it, sex is the sex that can be sold, that is always-already-for-sale.
* There is a premise concerning sexuality that pornography cannot accommodate, and that premise is that sexual integrity is inexchangeable: that it is not for sale.
* Sexual integrity is a construction, not a given; the task of sexual intelligence is to imagine and practice an inexchangeable sexuality.

That is:

* Pornography’s explicitness is always the making-explicit of something supposedly hidden; a culture in which sexuality was transparently and ubiquitously visible would have no pornography as such, no category of the pornographic. Pornography exposes, by subjecting that which is withheld from public circulation to the law of market exposure: everything must be capable of being formatted as a commodity and circulated as such.
* Because sexual integrity withdraws from exchange, it cannot be represented pornographically: at best, pornography offers a kind of spoof or travesty of integrity (at worst, which is more common, it actively assaults and denigrates it).
* Pornography is fantasy not only because it exaggerates or (from the consumer’s perspective) “improves” on reality, but because its logic is incompatible with the intelligent practice of sexuality. Porn can be made in clever ways by clever people, or at least by people pretending to be clever; but it precludes, has no time for, the exercise of that obstinate, creative human intelligence which seeks to encounter sexuality as the irruption of an inexchangeable Real.

Accordingly, we will not try to investigate the effects of pornography in terms of quantifiable social benefit or harm; rather, we will engage with pornography itself as a system of representation which is inimical, by design, to the flourishing of sexual intelligence. Taking the side of the inexchangeable, we will treat pornography as our enemy; we will scorn those who would re-educate us, through pornography, to accept our place in the laminated catalogue of sexual commodities. We refuse to become pornography; in particular, we refuse the cruel optimism of those who wish us to become good pornography, whose solution to the bestial crudity of actually-existing pornography is a form of “ethical consumerism” that would be mollified by bodily diversity and emotionally-engaging narrative context. We are not impressed by porn made by women, or for gay men, or featuring performers in wheelchairs. Lengthy preambles in which everyone painstakingly establishes the parameters of their “consent” will not convince us. We would rather have bestial crudity, which at least does not attempt to disguise its essential contempt for us - a contempt which we reciprocate with unwavering animosity.
